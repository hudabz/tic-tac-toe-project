# tic-tac-toe-project
I build two main pages for my project one like the home page linked to the tic tac toe game page, in addition to the css and jave script files. 

//technologies 
I used in my project the html5, css, js, jquery, media query (as token in class) 
//additional technoligies 
- Sweet alert to take an input from the user and show if he wins or tie. - Al boardman gifs to add freshness to my home page. 
- Audio to make the user encouraged during the game. 
- Animate css to make the header of my game. 

I faced a problem during saving the values of what the user choosed in it's right place in the array. 
also a problem at the end for adding an audio in the background of the home page. 

my favorite part was changing the css to be in what I was looking for in my project.
